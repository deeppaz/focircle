    <p>
        focircle is a bot that surfs on tumblr and downloads and posts inspiring photos
    </p>
    <p>
        for those who wonder the meaning of the focircle; the fo abbreviation comes from "fotograf(photographe)" excerpt
        from the french word photographe "image recording device and its process." the french word is an extract from
        the english word photograph, which means the same thing. (first use: 1839 sir john herschel, eng. physicist.)
        this word is a compound of the ancient greek phôs, phōt- φῶς, φωτ- "light" and the ancient Greek graphē γραφη
        "writing, record". circle is that we know :)

    <p>
        the developing focircle is not quite ready yet. but the logic is as follows;
        follows specific audience on tumblr and tags normally. it goes to the profile of the users in those tags If it
        matches with the sample photos, it downloads it and posts fotograf to us
    </p>

        <br/>
        it works for two social media, one tumblr and one twitter. focircle does not looking, searching or following on twitter. shares the same things focircle shared on tumblr to twitter
    </p>
    <p>
        it uses two separate packages. the packages use two packages, one <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tumblrwks">tumblrwks</a> and the other <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tumblrwks">twit</a>. is an artist written completely with nodejs.
